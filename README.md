# HyprShaders âœ¨

A curated collection of shaders for Hyprland and Hyprshade that I've gathered (or "borrowed") over time.

## Installation

Clone the repository into your Hyprland config directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0x15BA88FF/hyprshaders.git /path/to/shader/directory
```

 I store my shaders in `~/.config/hypr/hyprshaders/` because it fits in well with my [dotfiles]([https://github.com/0x15BA88FF/hyproasis).

## Usage

Before applying these awesome shaders, make sure you have [Hyprshade](https://github.com/loqusion/hyprshade) installed.

Once you have Hyprshade, you can easily apply a shader with the following command:

```bash
hyprshade toggle /path/to/shader
```

Just replace `/path/to/shader` with the specific shader file you want to use.
